  congenic strains module: fixed encoding of attributes in gff3 file

ver 1.3.15, May 29, 2015
  congenic strains module: changed attribute name from 'source' to 'origin'
   'source' is a reserved keyword in gff3 specification and having an attribute named 'source'
   messed up data in JBrowse

ver 1.3.14, May 28, 2015
  congenic strains module: code refactored to simplify it;
    multicongenics are now exported with object type set to 'multicongenic' instead of 'congenic'
    for multicongenics new attributes are exported: 'loc2','loc3', etc with the positions of other loci,
      f.e. loc2=Chr2:224991853..224991955

ver 1.3.13, May 26, 2015
  congenic strains module: in the notes field, every double-quote character is now replaced by a single-quote
  justification: (per Aurash)
  
    The source of the error was found within the “Note” field: JBrowse typically hates double-quotes, as this truncates
  individual feature descriptions (we’ve seen and dealt with this previously), but in this particular case, JBrowse went
  absolutely haywire in passing the IFrame when it saw both a double-quote and a backslash (literal “/”) within
  the Note field of this one very troublesome feature.
    Anyway, the fix:
  substitute all double-quotes into single strong quotes within the “Note” field for mutant strains tracks.

v 1.3.12, May 13, 2015
  congenic strains module now generates two files: one for congenics, second for mutants

v 1.3.11, Feb 2, 2015
  gene/qtl/strains/sslp/promoters/ontology tracks are exported with all chromosomes per one file;
  ontology tracks are split by object type: for genes/sslps/qtls/strains

v 1.3.10, Jan 29, 2015
  for Disease (RDO) and GeneDrug (CHEBI) tracks: an email is sent if new tracks / obsolete tracks are detected

v 1.3.9, Jan 26, 2015
  .gff3 files are generated compressed, with .gff3.gz extension

v 1.3.8, Jan 19, 2015

    and gff3 files are generated only for terms having annotations

v 1.3.7, Sep 26, 2014
  fixed generation for genes having transcripts mapped to multiple assemblies

v 1.3.6, Sep 5, 2014
  fixed generation for genes having positions and transcripts without positions

v 1.3.5, Aug 8, 2014
  generation of DO files optimized

v 1.3.4, Aug 7, 2014

  fixed generation of 'Alias' field

v 1.3.3, Aug 5, 2014

     are no longer in the generated gff3 files

v 1.3.2, Jun 27, 2014
  no more duplicates are generated for genes having loci on multiple genes

v 1.3.1, Jun 25, 2014
  an artificial feature line is generated for every gene without features (mostly pseudogenes and ncRNAs)
    otherwise these genes are not shown properly in JBrowse

v 1.3, Mar 31, 2014
  gff3 files are now more compatible with gff3 format -- after fixes the generated files do pass
   online gff3 validation at http://modencode.oicr.on.ca/cgi-bin/validate_gff3_online

v 1.2, Mar 27, 2014
  fixed generation of gff3 files for genes (it was generating multiple duplicated sections for genes/transcripts
  having multiple loci on a chromosome; also code simplified and refactored to speed up processing

v 1.1, Feb 28, 2014
  simplified processing of chromosomes, no more hard-coded chromosome 'conventions' that are unnatural
  (f.e. passing 21 to denote chr X in rat, or passing 21 to denote chr Y in mouse)
  now the chromosomes to be processed are passed in 'natural' format, f.e. you can specify for rat
  'chr:1-20,X' what is intuitive for a human to understand
